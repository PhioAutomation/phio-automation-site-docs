# BETA v1

My first inclincation toward building an editor in the browser came from a need to assess programming knowledge during an interview. Existing tools such as [CoderPad](https://coderpad.io/) do not support the IEC 61131-3 languages and it would be unfair to expect a candidate to have PLC software installed. Additionally, I saw a need for a simple sandbox type of tool for educational purposes. If someone wanted to learn python, for example, he or she could use Jupyter notebooks or even Google Colab and be up and running in minutes. Tools like [Replit](https://replit.com/) and [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) have improved the learning velocity for software engineers using more common languages and frameworks. Phio aims to do something similar for the industrial automation field.

Building a lexer, parser, linting, evaluator, and code editor has been months in the making. The initial feature set described by the documentation is only a beginning but includes almost all functions available on the major platforms and implements greater than 90% of the IEC 61131-3 standard for the structured text language. Constructs like functions, function blocks, user defined types, enumerations, and timers are all on the roadmap and will be added incrementally.

My hope is that this will become a platform for learning and education about the IEC 61131-3 standard that is used in the industrial automation industry and implemented by major players in their own software products. Once you learn one platform, the remaining ones become easier and easier. Welcome to the playground and enjoy!
